Hey there~!  
I'm `Myo`, a curious soul diving headfirst into the world of **CTFs** and **cybersecurity** — still learning, still hacking, still dreaming ✨

*Solve what I can, learn from what I can't.*


## 🌸 Current Mission

> _"Even if you are a novice, keep moving forward."_ — *Itou Makise, Steins;Gate*

I'm building my foundation and:
- Participating in beginner-friendly CTFs 🧠
- Writing down my thoughts and solutions 📓
- Slowly sharpening my skills one flag at a time 🏁


## 📝 My blog

📝 I keep all my CTF writeups here:  
➡️ [**myos-esc.gitbook.io/myos-esc.**](https://myos-esc.gitbook.io/myos-esc.)
